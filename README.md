# Ensemble Machine Learning

This project is about analyzing and predicting the sales prices of residential homes using the Ames Housing Dataset, which is a popular dataset in the field of machine learning and data science. The goal of this project is to develop a regression model that accurately predicts the sale price of homes based on various features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, etc.

## Dataset Overview

The Ames Housing Dataset contains a total of 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. The dataset was compiled by Dean De Cock for use in data science education and research, and it has become a popular choice for practicing data scientists due to its rich set of features and complex relationships between them.
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Before building the regression model, the dataset needed to be cleaned and preprocessed to remove missing values, handle categorical variables, and engineer new features. This involved performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and trends in the data, imputing missing values using appropriate techniques, and encoding categorical variables using one-hot encoding or label encoding.

## Model Development and Evaluation

Once the data was cleaned and preprocessed, several regression models were developed using popular machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, and random forests. The performance of each model was evaluated using various metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared value.
